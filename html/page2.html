            <h2 >Flagship Smartphone by Huawai</h2>
            <div class="img" ><img src="..\photos\p40s.webp" alt="P 40 pro" style="border-radius: 12px;"></div>
            <p>Huawei has just launched its latest phones, the P40 Series, consisting of three phones, the Huawei P40, Huawei P40 Pro and, coming later, the Huawei P40 Pro Plus.
                I’ve been testing the P40 Pro since shortly before it was announced. It has an astonishing camera, spellbinding design and great performance.<span id="dots0">...</span></p>
            <span id="more0"> <br><br><p>
                     There’s a big oblong unit where the cameras are – four in the case of the P40 Pro, plus flash and microphone. This is a big camera area, reminiscent of the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. Like that phone,
                it leads to an unintended consequence. If you’re typing a text in landscape orientation, it’s almost impossible to do it when the phone is on a flat surface as the bump is so deep it works almost like a see-saw so the phone bounces around a lot.
                It’s much easier if you have clad the phone in the soft, clear case Huawei supplies. The bump is deep but it rises with the slightest of curved edges at the base instead of being perfectly vertical.
                Huawei has honed its industrial design over recent years to create something elegant and unmistakable, and this bump detail is the latest example. Look closely at how the camera panel is divided in two, one part for the three main lenses,
                a smaller part for time-of-flight lens, flash and microphone. The two parts of the panel are colored differently and the line marking the two sections has curved corners matching the shape of the panel. It looks great.
                Huawei’s craftmanship has improved hugely and the use of color and material has become increasingly individual. You could recognize a Huawei phone even if the label fell off.
                Although I love the waterfall display on the Mate 30 Pro, and that phone’s central camera fixture, the Huawei P40 Pro is the most successfully integrated design from the company yet, with every part complementing the next.</p></span>

            <h2>K30 PRO reaches India with  Snapdragon 865</h2>
            <div class="img"  ><img src="..\photos\k30pro.webp" alt="k30 pro"></div>
            <p> Xiaomi has announced the Redmi K30 Pro, its latest high-spec-low-price contender. It’s the sequel to the K20 Pro (in Asia) / Mi 9T Pro (in Europe), one of last year’s most buzzed-about phones — at least in the regions where Xiaomi actually sells phones.
                <span id="dots1">...</span></p>
            <span id="more1"><br><br>
            <p >Unlike the K20 Pro, the K30 Pro is visually quite a bit different from its non-Pro predecessor, which was launched in China in December. There’s a circular camera module with four lenses arranged in a square, and Xiaomi is also bringing back the pop-up selfie camera as opposed to the regular K30’s hole-punch cutout.</p><br>
            <p >The K30 Pro has a Snapdragon 865 processor, which means it also offers 5G support. The 6.67 inch screen is a 1080p AMOLED panel with HDR10+, although it looks like the refresh rate is a standard 60Hz, which puts it out of step with most 2020 flagship phones. </p><br>

            <p >The camera system has a 64-megapixel primary sensor, a 13-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel macro camera, and a 5-megapixel telephoto that also has macro capabilities. Xiaomi is particularly talking up the magnification ability of that last camera, though a higher end “zoom edition” of the phone swaps it out for a telephoto that can shoot up to 30x hybrid zoom.</p><br>
            <p>Other specs include 8K video recording, a headphone jack, IP53 water resistance, NFC, Wi-Fi 6, a 4,700mAh battery, and 33W fast charging over USB-C. Xiaomi also claims the K30 Pro has a much better haptic feedback system powered by a linear motor, which should help fix one of the drawbacks of the K20 Pro.</p><br>
            <p >The K30 Pro will launch in China first and should come to India later. It may well see an eventual release in Europe, too, but if the K20 Pro is any indication it could be rebranded as the Mi 10T. </p><br>
            <p >In China, the range starts at 2,999 yuan ($425) for a K30 Pro with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, with multiple configurations priced between that and the 3,999-yuan ($565) 8GB/256GB K30 Pro Zoom. That should set it up as a capable competitor to Realme’s similarly equipped X50 Pro, unless the lack of a high refresh rate is a dealbreaker.</p><br>

            <h2>Samsung seeds yet another camera-focused update to Galaxy S20 series</h2>
            <div class="img"  ><img src="..\photos\s20.webp" alt="galaxy s20"></div>
            <p>Samsung has issued a new update for the Galaxy S20, S20+ and S20 Ultra in China, which brings the April security patch as well as some camera improvements.
                The update improves focus, HDR and fine-tunes the transition animations.<span id="dots2">...</span></p>

                    Samsung has released a number of updates for its Galaxy S20 series. Their focal points have been fixes for the trio's camera performance,
                    most notably the Galaxy S20 Ultra's dodgy autofocus. As with all firmware updates they are divided between devices and regions so it may take a bit of time to get to you.</span></p>
